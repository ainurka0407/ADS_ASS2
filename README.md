I have developed classes MyArrayList and MyLinkedList as implementations of ArrayList and LinkedList, respectively. These classes are designed to adhere to the MyList interface, which specifies methods such as add, set, addFirst, addLast, get, getFirst, getLast, remove, removeFirst, removeLast, sort, indexOf, lastIndexOf, exist, toArray, clear, size, and display.

In the implementation of MyArrayList and MyLinkedList, all these methods are included, and I've conducted some testing in the MainLists class.

For MyQueue and MyStack, I've utilized the concepts from MyLinkedList and have created an inner class called Node. The methods of MyQueue and MyStack are implemented using the functionality of MyLinkedList.

Additionally, for MyMinHeap, I've utilized MyArrayList for implementation. This class is designed to implement methods specific to a minimum heap.
